# Some scripts for floating window managers

In this repository there is sxhkdrc with bindings I use with xfwm4. It uses the scripts to move/arrange windows on the desktop. A bar and gaps are taken into account.

In order to use this config, copy these files to ~/.config/sxhkd/ and edit winvars according yto your setup

Requirements:
- xdotool
- xdo
- wmctrl
- sxhkd

I created these files, because I wanted organization like in tiling wm but with decorative borders of floating wm.

There also is workspaces.sh, which I use to show the workspaces in polybar.
